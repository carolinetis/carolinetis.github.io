    <div><div style="height:500px;">P0 <a href="0" class="lightbox_trigger"><div class = "prototypeText"> <img class = "image" alt = "P0 - Limbo" src = "images/p0-img0.PNG"><p>Get immerse in the player's experience for Limbo with this presentation. There is an implicit story telling in the game that makes us wonder... What’s going on? What is happening? Who are those people? Why are they after the little boy? This drives the player to move, and learn more...and die more!</p></div></a></div></div>
    <div><div style="height:850px;">P1 - Sport <a href="1" class="lightbox_trigger"><div class = "prototypeText"> <img class = "image" alt = "P1 - Sport" src = "images/p1-img0.gif" ><p>Ñavas is a realistically imaginative sport played in a platform with holes placed above the water. Stop the ball before the opposite team score, whacke it, pass it, push your opponents, swim and run up and down in the field. All of these while holding a very special stick. Join us if you want to push your skills to the limit.</p></div></a></div></div>
    <div><div style="height:350px;">P2 - Playground <a href="2" class="lightbox_trigger"><div class = "prototypeText"> <img class = "image" alt = "P2 - Playground" src = "images/p2-img0.PNG" ><p>Experience the free-playfulness of the future in our dynamic playground. Inspired in Ninja Warrior, we provide challenges that never stay the same. How you beat them is up to you! </p></div></a></div></div>
    <div><div style="height:580px;">P3 - Modding a Game <a href="3" class="lightbox_trigger"><div class = "prototypeText"> <img class = "image" alt = "P3 - Modding a Game" src = "images/p3-img0.PNG"><p>In ITU we wanted to know the results of playing the classic tetris, in co-op mode. Experience the game in this new social way. Communication is the key! </p></div></a></div></div>
    <div><div style="height:600px;">P4 - Viking Game <a href="4" class="lightbox_trigger"><div class = "prototypeText"> <img class = "image" alt = "P4 - Viking Game" src = "images/p4-img0.PNG" ><p>"The Corridor" is a fast paced, horror-themed board game, in which only one player loses, and nobody is to be trusted. By carefully choosing how to spend their action points each turn, players will have to find the perfect balance between moving away from the pursuing threat of reanimated corpses, and sabotaging other players, leaving them behind as bait. Imagine "The Walking Dead" meets "Ludo", but with communist zombies.</p></div></a></div></div>
	<div><div style="height:500px;">P5 - Babushka <a href="5" class="lightbox_trigger"><div class = "prototypeText"><img class = "image" alt = "P5 - Babushka" src = "images/p5-img0.PNG" ><p>Help this russian old lady to find the way back to the city. The taiga forest is an inhospitable place full of dangers, but Babushka is well trained and nothing will stop her. </p></div></a></div></div>
